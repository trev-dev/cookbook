# The Open Source Cookbook

A collection of useful recipes made or found, contributed by people I know.

This is a collaborative project for myself and anyone I know who cares enough about sharing recipes with me and cooking for one-another.

## Contributing

If you know me & you don't know how to use Github, send me the recipe somehow.

Otherwise, feel free to submit a pull request. All of the recipes are stored in the [recipe directory](./content/recipe)

Tip: I am using Michael Menu's [zk](https://github.com/mickael-menu/zk) to help template and reference recipes from my machine.  If the zettlekasten method of note taking interests you, check it out!  You can find the zk config directory in the content folder under `content/.zk`.
