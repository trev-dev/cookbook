One of my absolute favorite recipes. It was discovered, and altered by
my wife. I enjoy them most with peanut butter and warm berries that were
heated from frozen. Try them with any toppings you'd like.

*** Ingredients

- 4 mashed bananas. 5 if you're extra.
- 2 tsp vanilla
- 4 eggs
- 3 tsp baking powder
- 3/4 cup flour
- 1 tbsp of butter per pan.

*** Directions

1. Peel and thoroughly mash the bananas into a bowl.
2. Add the vanilla and eggs to the bowl and whisk the wet mixture until
   well mixed.
3. Start heating a pan with butter in it at medium to medium-high heat.
4. Once pan is hot, add flour and baking powder to the wet mixture.
   Whisk in the dry ingredients until your batter is consistent.
5. Using a ladle or a large spoon, portion your pancakes in the hot pan
   with enough space between them to flip with. When you see the
   pancakes thicken and the bubbles pop on top of them, flip the
   pancakes.
6. Repeat steps 3-5 until your batter is used up.

#+CAPTION: A lovely angelfood cake. Probably not what mine will look like.
[[file:static/angelfood.jpg]]

*** Ingredients

- 1-1/2 cups egg whites (about 10)
- 3/4 cup plus 1/2 cup sugar, divided
- 1/4 cup cornstarch
- 1/4 cup white rice flour
- 1/4 cup tapioca flour
- 1/4 cup potato starch
- 1-1/2 teaspoons cream of tartar
- 3/4 teaspoon salt
- 3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
- Assorted fresh fruit, optional

1. Place egg whites in a large bowl; let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes. Sift 3/4 cup sugar, cornstarch, flours and potato starch together twice; set aside.
2. Add cream of tartar, salt and vanilla to egg whites; beat on medium speed until soft peaks form. Gradually add remaining sugar, about 2 tablespoons at a time, beating on high until stiff peaks form. Gradually fold in flour mixture, about 1/2 cup at a time.
3. Gently spoon into an ungreased 10-in. tube pan. Cut through the batter with a knife to remove air pockets. Bake on the lowest oven rack at 350&deg; for 45-50 minutes or until lightly browned and entire top appears dry. Immediately invert pan; cool completely, about 1 hour.
4. Run a knife around side and center tube of pan. Remove cake to a serving plate. Top with fresh fruit if desired.

*** Ingredients
Some basmati or white along with the stuff required to make the Marinade and Curry.

**** Marinade

- 1/2 cup plain yoghurt, full fat
- 1 tbsp lemon juice
- 1 tsp tumeric powder
- 2 tsp garam masala (Note 1)
- 1/2 tsp chilli powder or cayenne pepper powder (Note 2)
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1 tbsp ginger, freshly grated
- 2 cloves garlic, crushed
- 1.5 lb / 750 g chicken thigh fillets, cut into bite size pieces

**** Curry

- 2 tbsp (30 g) ghee or butter, OR 1 tbsp vegetable oil (Note 3)
- 1 cup tomato passata (aka tomato puree) (Note 4)
- 1 cup heavy / thickened cream (Note 5)
- 1 tbsp sugar
- 1 1/4 tsp salt

*** Directions

1. Optional blitz:  for an extra smooth sauce, combine the Marinade ingredients (except the chicken) in a food processor and blend until smooth. (I do not do this)
2. Marinade:  Combine the Marinade ingredients with the chicken in a bowl. Cover and refrigerate overnight, or up to 24 hours (minimum 3 hrs).
3. Cook chicken:  Heat the ghee (butter or oil) over high heat in a large fry pan. Take the chicken out of the Marinade but do not wipe or shake off the marinade from the chicken (but don't pour the Marinade left in the bowl into the fry pan).
4. Place chicken in the fry pan and cook for around 3 minutes, or until the chicken is white all over (it doesn't really brown because of the Marinade).
5. Sauce: Add the tomato passata, cream, sugar and salt. Also add any remaining marinade left in the bowl. Turn down to low and simmer for 20 minutes. Do a taste test to see if it needs more salt.
6. Garnish with coriander/cilantro leaves if using. Serve with white/basmati rice.

:END:
*** Ingredients

- 1 (6 pound) bone-in country ham
- 30 whole cloves
- 3 cups apple cider, or as needed
- 1 cup brown sugar
- 1 cup maple syrup
- 2 tablespoons ground cinnamon
- 1 tablespoon ground nutmeg
- 2 teaspoons ground ginger
- 2 tablespoons ground cloves
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
- 1 orange's peel

*** Directions

1. Press whole cloves into the ham so they are evenly distributed. You may score the ham for easier insertion if you wish. Place the ham in a slow cooker. Pour in apple cider until only about 2 inches of ham is above the surface. Pack the brown sugar on top of the ham, pressing into the cloves. This will get washed away in the next step but any that stays on is a bonus.
2. Pour the maple syrup over the ham. Season the apple cider with cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, ground cloves and vanilla. Add the orange peel to the pot. Fill the slow cooker as full as you can with apple cider without going over the fill line. Cover and set to Low. Cook for 8 to 10 hours.

:END:
*** Ingredients

- 1 lb dry chickpeas (also known as garbanzo beans). You must start with dry, do NOT substitute canned, they will not work!
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 1 small onion, roughly chopped
- 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
- 3-5 cloves garlic (I prefer roasted garlic cloves)
- 1 1/2 tbsp flour or chickpea flour
- 1 3/4 tsp salt
- 2 tsp cumin
- 1 tsp ground coriander
- 1/4 tsp black pepper
- 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper
- Pinch of ground cardamom
- 1 tsp baking powder (optional - makes the falafel more fluffy)
- Vegetable oil for frying - grapeseed, sunflower, avocado, canola, and peanut oils all work well

*** Directions

1. One day ahead:  Pour the chickpeas into a large bowl and cover them by about 3 inches of cold water. Add 1/2 tsp of baking soda to the water and stir; this will help soften the chickpeas. Cover the bowl and let them soak overnight in a cool, dark place or in the refrigerator. The chickpeas should soak at least 12 hours and up to 24 hours, until tender (change soaking water for fresh water after 12 hours). They will double in size as they soak – you will have between 4 and 5 cups of beans after soaking.
2. Drain and rinse the chickpeas well. Pour them into your food processor along with the chopped onion, garlic cloves, parsley, flour or chickpea flour (use chickpea flour to make gluten free), salt, cumin, ground coriander, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and cardamom.  Note : if you have a smaller food processor, you will want to divide the ingredients in half and process the mixture one batch at a time.
3. Pulse all ingredients together until a rough, coarse meal forms. Scrape the sides of the processor periodically and push the mixture down the sides. Process until the mixture is somewhere between the texture of couscous and a paste. You want the mixture to hold together, and a more paste-like consistency will help with that... but don't over-process, you don't want it turning into hummus!
4. Once the mixture reaches the desired consistency, pour it out into a bowl and use a fork to stir; this will make the texture more even throughout. Remove any large chickpea chunks that the processor missed.  Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1-2 hours.  Fill a skillet with vegetable oil to a depth of 1 ½ inches. I prefer to use cooking oil with a high smoke point, like grapeseed. Heat the oil slowly over medium heat. The ideal temperature to fry falafel is between 360 and 375 degrees F; the best way to monitor the temperature is to use a deep fry or candy thermometer. After making these a few times, you will start to get a feel for when the oil temperature is "right."  Meanwhile, form falafel mixture into round balls or slider-shaped patties using wet hands or a falafel scoop. I usually use about 2 tbsp of mixture per falafel. You can make them smaller or larger depending on your personal preference. The balls will stick together loosely at first, but will bind nicely once they begin to fry.
5. If the balls won't hold together, place the mixture back in the processor again and continue processing to make it more paste-like. Keep in mind that the balls will be delicate at first; if you can get them into the hot oil, they will bind together and stick. If they still won't hold together, you can try adding 2-3 tbsp of flour or chickpea flour to the mixture. If they still won't hold, add 1-2 eggs to the mix. This should fix any issues you are having.  Before frying my first batch of falafel, I like to fry a test one in the center of the pan. If the oil is at the right temperature, it will take 2-3 minutes per side to brown (5-6 minutes total). If it browns faster than that, your oil is too hot and your falafels will not be fully cooked in the center. Cool the oil down slightly and try again.
6. When the oil is at the right temperature, fry the falafels in batches of 5-6 at a time until golden brown on both sides.
7. Once the falafels are fried, remove them from the oil using a slotted spoon.
8. Let them drain on paper towels. Serve the falafels fresh and hot; they go best with a plate of hummus and topped with creamy tahini sauce. You can also stuff them into a pita.
9. SESAME FALAFEL VARIATION : After forming the balls or patties, dip them in sesame seeds prior to frying. This will make the falafel coating crunchier and give it a slightly nutty flavor.
10. HERB FALAFEL VARIATION (GREEN FALAFEL) : Add ½ cup additional chopped green parsley, or cilantro, or a mixture of the two prior to blending.
11. TURMERIC FALAFEL (YELLOW FALAFEL) : Add ¾ tsp turmeric to the food processor prior to blending.
12. HOW TO MAKE A FALAFEL PITA : Making a falafel pita is actually really simple. The two main ingredients are pita bread and falafel.   Cut the pita bread in half to form two “pockets.” Each pocket is a serving size. Stuff the pocket with falafel, as well as any add-ons you fancy.  Here are some traditional add-ons that can be added to your pita: tahini sauce, shredded lettuce, diced or sliced tomatoes, Israeli salad, onions, dill pickles, hummus, tabouli, french fries
13. Here are some less traditional add-ons that are also tasty: sprouts, cucumber slices, roasted peppers, roasted eggplant slices, sunflower seeds, feta cheese, yogurt, tzatziki.

:END:

*** Ingredients

- 4-6 thick-cut boneless pork chops
- salt and pepper
- 1 cup ketchup
- 2/3 cup brown sugar - packed
  - Try half this amount for a healther sauce. Still delicious
- 3 tablespoons worcestershire sauce
- 3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
- 2 tablespoons dijon mustard
- 1 teaspoon mesquite seasoning  -  see note
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon cracked black pepper  -  if using ground pepper, reduce to 1/8 teaspoon

*** Directions

1. In a medium sauce pan over medium heat, combine all ingredients for the bbq sauce. Bring to a boil, reduce to low and simmer for 5 minutes, stirring throughout. Reduce from heat and set aside.
2. Preheat grill to medium and oil the grates.
3. Season pork chops generously with salt and pepper on both sides.
4. Place pork chops on the grill, cook for 2-3 minutes, then turn over and brush bbq sauce all over the tops and sides of the pork chops. Cook another 5-7 minutes, then turn and brush bbq sauce all over the tops and sides again.
5. Cook 5-7 minutes longer until internal temperature reaches 140 degrees F or there is no longer any pink in the center. Allow to rest on a plate or cutting board – covered – for at least 5 minutes before serving – this is KEY to keeping the pork chops nice and juicy.
6. Serve with remaining bbq sauce. Enjoy!

This is a really simple way to feed a lot of guests, or have a lot of leftovers. Baked or roasted chicken is delicious. This recipe works well for a barbeque or oven-roasting.

It's worth noting that this roasting and seasoning techiques work well for simple cuts of chicken such as breast, or thighs. I just enjoy doing a whole chicken as you get a lot of meat for the same effort.

*** Ingredients

- A whole chicken
- The lazy kind of seasoned salt. Try to get the "no msg added" kind

*** Directions

1. Pre-heat your oven to 390 degrees farenheit, or start your barbeque.
2. With a pair of kitchen shears, cut alongside the chicken's spine from front-to-back on both sides of the spine. The goal is to remove the spine entirely.
3. Turn the chicken over and spread the now opened back of the chicken with your fingers. Use your thumbs to apply pressure to the sternum between the breasts on the front of the chicken. Apply enough pressure to hear the front of the ribs crack.
4. Lay the chicken down with the inside facing down and use the palm of your hand to apply more pressure to the checks to ensure that the back-side of the chicken's ribs lay fully flat.
5. Apply a generous amount of the seasoned salt to all areas of the chicken.
6. If you're using an oven, cook the chicken for about 35-50 minutes, or until the internal temperature of the chicken is 160ish Farenheit. If you're aiming for the right temperature, be sure to test near the bone and watch for signs of raw chicken when you take the thermometer out.
7. If you're using a barbeque, the directions are pretty much the same unless you're cooking with charcoal. Be extra diligent and take your time with roasting on charcoal, be sure to use a generous amount of charcoal brickettes/lumped coal. Charcoal grilling takes about an hour.
8. Serve with any sides you like. I enjoy rice and roasted vegetables.

:END:

*** Equipment

- Chef's knife
- Cutting board
- 2 wide-mouth pint jars with lids
- Large pot, if canning

*** Ingredients

- 1 1/2 pounds Kirby or Persian cucumbers
- 4 cloves garlic, peeled and smashed
- 2 teaspoons dill seeds
- 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)
- 1 cup apple cider vinegar (or white vinegar)
- 1 cup water
- 1 1/2 tablespoons pickling salt or kosher salt

*** Directions

1. Prepare the jars. If you are planning to can your pickles for long-term storage, bring a large pot of water to a boil and sterilize 2 wide-mouth pint jars and their lids. If you are planning to make refrigerator pickles, simply washing the jars and lids is fine.
2. Prepare the cucumbers. Wash and dry the cucumbers. Trim away the blossom or stem end of the cucumber, which contains enzymes that can lead to limp pickles. Leave the cucumbers whole, cut them into spears, or slice them into coins, as desired.
3. Add the spices to the jars. Divide the garlic, dill seed, and red pepper flakes between the pint jars: 2 smashed cloves, 1 teaspoon dill seed, and 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes (if using) per jar.
4. Pack the cucumbers into the jars. Pack the cucumbers into the jars. Trim the ends if they stand more than 1/2 inch below the top of the jar. Pack them in as tightly as you can without smashing the cucumbers.
5. Bring the pickling brine to a boil. Place the vinegar, water, and salt in a small saucepan over high heat and bring to a rolling boil. Pour the brine over the pickles, filling each jar to within 1/2-inch of the top. You may not use all the brine.
6. Remove any air bubbles. Gently tap the jars against the counter a few times to remove all the air bubbles. Top off with more pickling brine if necessary.
7. Tighten the lids. Place the lids over the jars and screw on the rings until tight.
8. Optional — Process the pickles for longer storage. For longer storage, place the jars in a boiling pot of water to can them. When the water comes back to a boil, set the timer for 5 minutes and remove the jars immediately. Make sure the lids pop down; if they do not, refrigerate those pickles and eat them first.
9. Cool and refrigerate. Let the jars cool to room temperature. If you processed the jars, they can be stored unopened at room temperature. If unprocessed, refrigerate the pickles. The pickles will improve with flavor as they age — try to wait at least 48 hours before cracking them open.
10. Storing pickles. Canned pickles will keep for at least a year on the shelf and for several weeks in the refrigerator once opened; refrigerator pickles will keep for several weeks.

My family goes nuts for this peanut sauce. Pun intended. It is probably the strong driver of Asian inspired meals in my home.

*** Ingredients
- 3/4 cup creamy peanut butter
- 1/4 cup rice vinegar
- 1/3 cup reduced sodium tamari or reduced-sodium soy sauce
- 3 tablespoons honey
- 1 1/2 teaspoons grated fresh ginger or 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
- 1 to 2 medium cloves garlic, pressed or minced, to taste
- 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes, plus more for sprinkling
- 2 to 4 tablespoons water or coconut milk, or as necessary to reach your desired consistency
- Optional garnishes: sprinkling of chopped roasted peanuts and additional red pepper flakes

*** Directions
1. In a 2-cup liquid measuring cup or medium-sized mixing bowl, whisk together the ingredients until well blended. If your peanut butter is particularly thick, you may need to use the full 4 tablespoons of water to thin out the mixture (or more, if necessary).
2. Feel free to adjust to taste here—for example, sometimes I want my sauce more savory and add another clove of garlic, or a little sweeter, so I add extra honey.
3. If you're serving the sauce as a party dip, transfer it to a serving bowl and sprinkle with chopped peanuts and red pepper flakes for some visual interest!
