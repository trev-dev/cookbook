Great for a party.  Cut the ingredients in half if you want a modest amount.
You can also skip the marinate period to cut the time down to about an hour,
they will still be delicious.

## Ingredients {#ingredients}

- 4-5 pounds of chicken wings
- 2 cups of brown sugar
- 1 cup of Dijon mustard
- 1/4 cup of wheat free tamari

## Directions {#directions}

1. Whisk sugar, mustard and tamari in a bowl.  Move 1/2 a cup of the resulting
   marinade aside for basting later.
2. Put the chicken and marinade in a large freezer/zip-lock bag.  Put it in the
   fridge for 2 hours minimum.  Leave overnight if you can.
3. Pre-heat the oven to 375 degrees.
4. Line a couple of pans with parchment paper or aluminum foil.  Place the
   chicken on the pan(s).  Bake for 30 minutes.
5. Flip the chicken with tongs, then baste the chicken.
6. Bake for another 20-30 minutes.  Chicken should be well cooked and falling
   off the bone when done.
