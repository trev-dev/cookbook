The source URL for this recipe is good but it calls for 3/4 cups of milk, which
makes the batter almost as thick as clay.  I use more milk.  If your batter ends
up too thin just add little bits of flour until it feels right.

## Ingredients {#ingredients}

- 1 cup gluten free flour
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon of salt
- 1 1/4 cup of milk
- 1 large eggs
- 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- butter for the pan

## Directions {#directions}

1. Start heating your pan/skillet on medium high heat
2. Whisk the dry ingredients and wet ingredients in separate bowls
3. Combine the two bowls into one and whisk thoroughly.  Add flour if necessary
   to get the right thickness
4. Melt butter on the pan so the cakes don't stick.  Use a ladle or a big spoon
   to spoon out your pancakes onto the pan
5. Once the pancakes thicken and/or have bubbles, flip them
6. One both sides are golden brown and the pancakes feel fluffy, set them aside
7. Repeat steps 4-6 as necessary
8. Serve with whatever pancake toppings you want
