This recipe comes from my aunt-in-law, Kay. My wife had it at her home on a trip up-island while I was stuck at home looking after the dog. My wife raved about it :)

Kay did call for a specific brand of Greek seasoning. I chose to separate that into its material components to make it simpler to prepare. If you can find "Cavender's" all purpose Greek seasoning, use that.


## Ingredients {#ingredients}

-   2-3lbs of chicken (thighs, breast, wings, whatever)
-   2/3 cup of butter
-   2 tbsp of [greek seasoning]({{< relref "greek-seasoning" >}}) (or Cavender's, if you can find it)
-   1 clove of minced garlic
-   1 tbsp of dried Terragon leaves
-   1 tsp of dill weed
-   1 tsp of lemon pepper seasoning (optional)


## Directions {#directions}

1.  Start pre-heating the oven to 380 degrees
2.  Melt the butter in a microwave or by double-boiling it
3.  Mix the herbs and spices into the butter thoroughly
4.  Place chicken on a baking pan and generously slather it in the seasoned butter
5.  Once oven is heated, put the chicken into the oven
6.  Check the chicken periodically. Cooking should take 30-45 minutes, depending on how much meat &amp; bone you have in your cuts of chicken.
