We got this one from a keto experiment we tried a while back. This was our favorite discovery. The rest of the keto experiment was pretty expensive and kinda sucked. Would not recommend keto if you love your arteries.

If you don't want to use sausage you can use diced chicken, steak or pork. I feel like ground meat is a bit to crumbly.


## Equipment {#equipment}

-   A food processor. An 8 cup processor makes this easy if you have one


## Ingredients {#ingredients}

-   1 medium sized head of cauliflower
-   2 bell peppers of different chopped colors
-   1 cup of chopped zucchini
-   1 medium chopped onion
-   1 clove of minced garlic
-   2 tbsp Italian or [greek style]({{< relref "greek-seasoning" >}}) seasoning.
-   tbsp olive oil
-   About a pound of sausage, usually 4 large links, of any kind


## Directions {#directions}

1.  Pre-cook your sausage in a pan
2.  Cut up the cauliflower in to small spears and use your food processor to break it down into small flakes. You want it to be "rice-like" in consistency. With an 8 cup processor this can take a couple of rounds. Set aside cauliflower for later
3.  With a wok, skillet or large pot, heat the olive oil to medium heat. Add onion and garlic. Cook for 1 minute until tender
4.  Add all other vegetables except the processed cauliflower. Cook until slightly tender, roughly 4-5 minutes
5.  Add meat, process cauliflower and the rest of the herbs/spices. Let it simmer for 20 or so minutes
