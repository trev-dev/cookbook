Eggnog is an absolute favorite of mine. Now that I can make it any day of the
year, I will have to show some restraint. It goes great with rum!

## Ingredients {#ingredients}

- 6 large egg yolks
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 1 cup heavy whipping cream
- 2 cups milk
- 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1 pinch of salt
- 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract

## Directions {#directions}

1. Whisk the egg yolks and sugar together in a medium bowl until light and
   creamy.
2. In a saucepan over medium-high heat, combine the cream, milk, nutmeg and 
   salt. Stir often until mixture reaches 200 degrees F.
3. Add a big spoonful of the hot milk to the egg mixture, whisking vigorously.
   Repeat, adding a big spoonful at a time, to temper the eggs. 
4. Once most of the hot milk has been added to the eggs, pour the mixture back
   into the saucepan on the stove. 
5. Whisk constantly for a minute or so, until the mixture is just slightly
   thickened (or until it reaches about 160 degrees F on a thermometer).
   It will thicken more as it cools.
6. Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla, and alcohol*, if using.
7. Pour the eggnog through a fine mesh strainer into a pitcher or other
   container and cover with plastic wrap. 
8. Refrigerate until chilled. It will thicken as it cools. If you want a
   thinner, completely smooth consistency, you can add the entire mixture to a
   blender with 1 or 2 tablespoons of milk and blend until smooth.
9. Serve with a sprinkle of cinnamon or nutmeg, and fresh whipped cream, if
   desired.
10. Store homemade eggnog in the fridge for up to one week.
