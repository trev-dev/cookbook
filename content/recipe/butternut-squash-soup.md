## Ingredients {#ingredients}

-   2 tablespoons butter
-   1 small onion, chopped
-   1 stalk celery, chopped
-   1 medium carrot, chopped
-   2 medium potatoes, cubed
-   1 medium butternut squash - peeled, seeded, and cubed
-   1 (32 fluid ounce) container chicken stock
-   salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste


## Directions {#directions}

1.  Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat, and cook onion, celery, carrot, potatoes, and squash until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Pour in enough of the chicken stock to cover vegetables.
2.  Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to low, cover pot, and simmer until all vegetables are tender, about 40 minutes.
3.  Transfer the soup to a blender, and blend until smooth. Return to the pot, and mix in any remaining stock to reach desired consistency. Season with salt and pepper.
