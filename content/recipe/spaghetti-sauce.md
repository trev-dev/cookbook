This is a really simple, adaptable recipe for making any kind of pasta sauce that you would like.

Some suggestions for what you can do with it add a pound of meat, whiskey, veggies, whatever. I personally enjoy adding bell peppers, carrot, zucchini and beef.

If you want to prepare bulk meals this recipe is great for freezing if you want to double it.
