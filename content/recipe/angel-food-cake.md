## Ingredients {#ingredients}

-   1-1/2 cups egg whites (about 10)
-   3/4 cup plus 1/2 cup sugar, divided
-   1/4 cup cornstarch
-   1/4 cup white rice flour
-   1/4 cup tapioca flour
-   1/4 cup potato starch
-   1-1/2 teaspoons cream of tartar
-   3/4 teaspoon salt
-   3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
-   Assorted fresh fruit, optional


## Directions {#directions}

1.  Place egg whites in a large bowl; let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes. Sift 3/4 cup sugar, cornstarch, flours and potato starch together twice; set aside.
2.  Add cream of tartar, salt and vanilla to egg whites; beat on medium speed until soft peaks form. Gradually add remaining sugar, about 2 tablespoons at a time, beating on high until stiff peaks form. Gradually fold in flour mixture, about 1/2 cup at a time.
3.  Gently spoon into an ungreased 10-in. tube pan. Cut through the batter with a knife to remove air pockets. Bake on the lowest oven rack at 350&amp;deg; for 45-50 minutes or until lightly browned and entire top appears dry. Immediately invert pan; cool completely, about 1 hour.
4.  Run a knife around side and center tube of pan. Remove cake to a serving plate. Top with fresh fruit if desired.
