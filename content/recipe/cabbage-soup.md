A beautiful, fall/winter soup.  It makes a large batch and freezes well.

This recipe was found in my local newspaper.

## Ingredients

-  1 lb lean ground beef
-  1 medium onion, diced
-  2 large garlic cloves, minced
-  3/4 cup carrot, grated
-  2 tbsps tomato paste
-  4 cups of cabbage, cubed (roughly 1 whole small cabbage)
-  3 3/4 cups of beef broth
-  1 cup of vegetable juice (V8 brand or something like it)
-  1 28oz/796ml can of diced tomatoes
-  1 13oz/398ml can of tomato sauce
-  2 tbsp brown sugar
-  1 tbsp [worchestershire sauce]({{< relref "worchestershire-sauce" >}})
-  1 bay leaf
-  1/2 cup of rice
-  2 green onions, halved and sliced
-  Salt and pepper to taste

## Directions

1.  Set a large pot on the range for medium, medium-high heat
2.  Cook beef until brown.  Drain the grease
3.  Add onion, carrot and garlic.  Cook and stir for 3-4 minutes
4.  Mix in tomato paste and cook for another minute
5.  Add cabbage, broth, vegetable juice, diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, brown sugar, worchestershire sauce and the bay leaf
