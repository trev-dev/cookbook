I just enjoy doing a whole chicken as you get a lot of meat for the same effort.</description></item><item><title>Worchestershire Sauce</title><link>https://trev-dev.github.io/cookbook/recipe/worchestershire-sauce/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jan 2020 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://trev-dev.github.io/cookbook/recipe/worchestershire-sauce/</guid><description>Need a solution for seasoning red meat that won&amp;rsquo;t hurt a celiac person?
