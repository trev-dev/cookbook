It was discovered, and altered by my wife. I enjoy them most with peanut butter and warm berries that were heated from frozen. Try them with any toppings you&amp;rsquo;d like.
Use 1-1 gluten free baking flour to make it GF.
Ingredients 4 mashed bananas. 5 if you&amp;rsquo;re extra. 2 tsp vanilla 4 eggs 3 tsp baking powder 3/4 cup flour 1 tbsp of butter per pan.</description></item><item><title>Roasted Spachcock Chicken</title><link>https://trev-dev.github.io/cookbook/recipe/roasted-spachcock-chicken/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 May 2021 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://trev-dev.github.io/cookbook/recipe/roasted-spachcock-chicken/</guid><description>This is a really simple way to feed a lot of guests, or have a lot of leftovers. Baked or roasted chicken is delicious. This recipe works well for a barbeque or oven-roasting.
It&amp;rsquo;s worth noting that this roasting and seasoning techiques work well for simple cuts of chicken such as breast, or thighs. I just enjoy doing a whole chicken as you get a lot of meat for the same effort.</description></item><item><title>Spachcock Chicken</title><link>https://trev-dev.github.io/cookbook/recipe/spachcock-chicken/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 May 2021 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://trev-dev.github.io/cookbook/recipe/spachcock-chicken/</guid><description>This is a really simple way to feed a lot of guests, or have a lot of leftovers.
